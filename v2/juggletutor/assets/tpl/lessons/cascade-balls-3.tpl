<h4>1 Ball</h4>
<img src="/assets/img/lessons/cascade-balls-3/1.png" class="right">
<ul>
	<li>
		Start with one ball in your right hand, holding it at waste level.
	</li>
	<li>
		Throw this ball in a narrow arc to about forehead level and catch it (gently) with your left hand.
	</li>
	<li>
		Now throw the ball back to your right hand in a similar fashion.
	</li>
	<li>
		Practice keeping the ball at a consistent height and location, and keeping it from moving forwards or backwards. You should not move your feet at all. Take your time and concentrate.
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>2 Balls</h4>
<img src="/assets/img/lessons/cascade-balls-3/2.png" class="right">
<ul>
	<li>
		Take two balls, one in each hand. Like before toss the ball in your right hand and when that ball has reached its apex (its highest point) toss the ball in your left hand underneath the first one, but still using the same narrow arc as before.
	</li>
	<li>
		This will free your left hand to catch the first ball using a counterclockwise circular motion which would normally prepare it to throw the ball again. In this case stop after tossing both balls so you can focus on catching them.
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>3 Balls</h4>
<img src="/assets/img/lessons/cascade-balls-3/3.gif" class="right">
<ul>
	<li>
		Start with two balls in your right hand and one ball in your left. First try to do 3 throws (right, left, right) without dropping a ball. This is known as a flash. Keep practicing this until you feel like you can throw and catch the balls consistently.
	</li>
	<li>
		Now try to do 4 throws (right, left, right, left). Then 5, 6, 7, etc... Eventually you should be able to juggle continuously.
	</li>
</ul>
